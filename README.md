Module 9 Challenge

This repository contains files related to a research project about company employees during the 1980s and 1990s. The project started with six CSV files of employee data from that period. The `data` folder contains the original CSV files.

The project designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database and then queried the database to answer questions about the data.

## Repository Contents
- data: Copies of the original six CSV files of employee data
- Employees DB ERD.png: Entity relationship diagram of the Employees database
- data_analysis.sql: Copy of SQL statements used to analyze the employee data
- data_modeling.sql: Copy of SQL statements used during data engineering to support importing the original CSV files
